## Dramatist

Dramatist is a LaTeX package for typesetting drama. Version 1.2 is on
CTAN and is distributed with TeX Live and MikTeX. Here is hosted the,
still experimental, code that will eventually become version 2.0. The
new code breaks many compatibilities, so, don't use it with documents
that use an older version of dramatist.
